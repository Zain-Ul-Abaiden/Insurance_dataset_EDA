# Insurance Dataset EDA

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an insurance dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the characteristics of an insurance dataset, uncover patterns, and gain insights into the factors affecting insurance charges.

## Dataset
- **File:** `insurance.csv`
- **Rows:** 1338
- **Columns:** 7
- **Features:**
  - `age`: Age of primary beneficiary

  - `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by insurance
  - `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no)
  - `region`: Residential area in the US
  - `charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Analysis Steps
The EDA notebook (`Insurance_Dataset_EDA.ipynb`) includes:
- Data loading and initial inspection
- Data shape, column names, and data types
- Summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles)
- Checking for missing values
- Data visualization (distribution plots, correlation analysis, etc.)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Open `Insurance_Dataset_EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
